# Client-Server
A simple message application using client-server architecture models in python
You can have a look at the documentation for socket module at [python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/sockets.html) for more examples. Test it just by connecting two computers via a mobile hotspot or router. One computer should play client role and the other, server role. Just look up the code.
