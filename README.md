## Client-Server Message Application

This is a simple message application utilizing client-server architecture in Python. It allows two computers to communicate with each other over a network, one acting as the client and the other as the server.

### How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on both computers.
3. Be on the same network, e.g., on a single hotspot or router that may not have an internet connection.
4. Get the IP address of the server by running `ipconfig` command on the terminal and put it in the placeholder in the `client.py` file.
5. On the server computer, run the server file (`server.py`), and on the client computer, run the client file (`client.py`). That's it!

### Notes
- Make sure both computers are connected to the same network.
- This is a basic demonstration of client-server communication and does not include advanced features like encryption or error handling.
- Feel free to modify the code as needed for your projects.
